# 👋 Hi, I'm Osvaldo Landi Júnior

I'm a medical doctor specialized in Radiology, with fellowship in Imaging Informatics.  

I work as the innovation manager for FIDI, a non-profit organization where I lead AI projects for healthcare with real impact on public health: [AI for Chest X-Rays In Emergency](https://epocanegocios.globo.com/inteligencia-artificial/ia-na-pratica/noticia/2025/05/ia-reduz-espera-de-resultado-de-raio-x-de-torax-de-uma-hora-para-5-minutos-em-pronto-socorro-do-hspe.ghtml)

Also, I'm a co-founder and product lead for a digital health startup for structured reporting: [nReport](https://www.ionic.health/nreport).
